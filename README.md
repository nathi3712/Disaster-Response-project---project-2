## Installation:

All libraries available on Anaconda distribution of python.
Ubuntu IDE platform was used for this project.
Java scripts provided for the app interactive pages.

## Reason for the project:

This is my Udacity Data Science project focusing on the use of pipelines.
The project is about creating an app that can help is a disaster situation for responders to know what type of problem is at play so as to provide the correct solution/response.
This project shows how the app can take key words, and put them under predefined (catergories) so as to help responders to be proactive in the kind of help that is needed.

## File Descriptions:

I have included datasets from python notebook files where the ETL and ML pipelines were created.
I have added the notebooks for processing, training and running the project.
The template file contains the java script data for the web app layout which can be used to interact with the app.
pkl dump file generated from taining is not added as it is too large and can't go through.


## Results:

This is an example of the app and how is responds.

Below we see the first page of the app with some graphical represantation of the data from the dataset showing the 3 main sources of the data:
